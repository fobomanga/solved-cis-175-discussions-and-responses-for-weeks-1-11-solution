<strong>Week 3 :</strong>

[Question]: <strong>“Ethernet” </strong> Please respond to the following:

<ul>

 <li>Imagine that you work as a network administrator for a small manufacturing company.

Recommend the cabling type that you would use in this network, and provide a rationale to your superiors.</li>

</ul>

Imagine that your company is using 100BaseTX cabling, and you need to provide access to a machine that is located 400 meters from the switch. Recommend one (1) strategy to accomplish this task, and justify your chosen strategy.

<strong>Week 4 :</strong>[Question]: “IP Basic Concepts” Please respond to the following:&#x25aa; Suppose that you work for a company that has been using IPv4 in each of its networks. After hearing a discussion about the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, your boss comes to you for advice on whether or not the company should upgrade each of its networks to IPv6. Suggest whether or not your boss should upgrade each network to IPv6. Provide at least two (2) reasons for your suggestion.Suppose you work for a small company that has three (3) routers in its network design. Determine whether you would use static or dynamic routing to connect the routers. Justify your response with the key benefits that your choice provides.

<strong>Week 5 :</strong>

[Question]: <strong>“Securing a Home Network” </strong> Please respond to the following:

<strong>Week 6 :</strong>

[Question]: <strong>“Optimizing Performance” </strong> Please respond to the following:

<ul>

From the e-Activity, examine two (2) strategies for tuning the network adapter of a Microsoft 2008 Server. Determine whether or not you would apply the same strategies to Windows Server 2012. Provide a rationale for your response.

<strong>Week 7 :</strong>

[Question]: <strong>“Command Line Tools” </strong> Please respond to the following:

<ul>

 <li>Suppose you are a network administrator and your boss indicates that a budget has been set aside to upgrade the network servers for the entire company. Your boss asks you to recommend whether the company should upgrade the network servers to Windows servers, UNIX servers, or Citrix Servers. Compare and contrast these network servers and make a recommendation for your boss. Provide a rationale for your response.</li>

</ul>

Per the text, the command-line utilities “ipconfig” and “ifconfig” are used to gather basic information about a computer’s network interface on Windows and UNIX respectively. Of the two (2) utilities mentioned, determine the single utility that you would prefer to use to gather and view diagnostic information. Provide a rationale for your response.
